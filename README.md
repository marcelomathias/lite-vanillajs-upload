# lite-vanillajs-uploader

Lightweight and simple upload and client-side image compression component!

## Before anything, select the right files

Ok.. not that big deal, but it is possible to select allowed file formats and max size. Believe me, I know people who embedded flash components only to perform that task... Oh, the nineties...

## Then, it does an awesome client-side image resize!

Using canvas component, **lite-vanillajs-uploader** can easily resize images! Isn't it nice? We can control the maximun size of the image and the goal max file size. With some simple, but effective algorythmn, it adjusts the image quality and let the file ready to go. (Beam it up, Scotty!)

Our storage billing does thanks this!

## Finally, upload the file!

We like vanilla! With simple native resources, we can do an ellegant and simple work, calling endpoints via post with multipart files, or even some REST service.


## Oh yes, those thumbails are cute!

**lite-vanillajs-uploader** was develped to support multiple uploads. In the case of photos or images, those thumbnails can make the user experience nicer! So, why not?


## TO-DO list

Beautifully wrap a toughtful gift can be exhausting, sometimes. Despite of that, I couldn't wait for it! Fortunatelly, we can do some polishing as we go.

Things what I wanna accomplish very soon:

* Create an example of uploading to an REST service
* Create andexample of uploading to google cloud storage
* equalize language in names of functions and variables
* Friendly show thumbnails of other kinds of media/extensions
* Upload status in the thumbails

## But, well... it is already useful

If you need some solution like this, go ahead, you can already use it!

Just let me know. We can celebrate together!
